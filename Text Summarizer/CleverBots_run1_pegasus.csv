S0010448513001553," ""We explore the notion of a Well spaced Blue noise Distribution WBD of points which combines two desirable properties. First the point distribution is random as measured by its spectrum having blue noise. Second it is well spaced in the sense that the minimum separation distance between samples is large compared to the maximum coverage distance between a domain point and a sample i.e. its Voronoi cell aspect ratios are small. It is well known that maximizing one of these properties destroys the other uniform random points have no aspect ratio bound and the vertices of an equilateral triangular tiling have no randomness. However we show that there is a lot of room in the middle to get good values for both. Maximal Poisson disk sampling provides and blue noise. We show that a standard optimization technique can improve the well spacedness while preserving randomness. Given a random point set our Opt beta algorithm iterates over the points and for each point locally optimizes its Voronoi cell aspect ratio . It can improve to a large fraction of the theoretical bound given by a structured tiling improving from 1.0 to around 0.8 about half way to 0.58 while preserving most of the randomness of the original set. In terms of both and randomness the output of Opt compares favorably to alternative point improvement techniques such as centroidal Voronoi tessellation with a constant density function which do not target directly. We demonstrate the usefulness of our output through meshing and filtering applications. An open problem is constructing from scratch a WBD distribution with a guarantee of beta 1.""",Given a random point set our Opt beta algorithm iterates over the points and for each point locally optimizes its Voronoi cell aspect ratio.

The high coupling between the 2D pattern making and 3D garment design blocks the designers creations. In this paper a novel approach that decouples the high coupling between garment design and pattern making is proposed. Our approach is examples based. 3D new garment models are created on individual human models by compositing 3D parts from garment examples rather than 2D patterns. The main benefit of our approach is that it is easy to operate and capable to create elegant individualized garments with highly detailed geometries. Garment prototypes represented in Coons surface automatically generated from individual human models are used to guide the garment parts composition and locally parameterize the garment parts. With the local parameterization the garment parts and the newly created garment models can be interactively edited by altering the parametric curves on the garment prototypes. Our approach makes it possible for both the designers and the common customers to express their creations and imaginations conveniently in a 3D graphical way.""",3D new garment models are created on individual human models by compositing 3D parts from garment examples rather than 2D patterns.
S0010448513001644," ""We present a novel approach to feature aware mesh deformation . Previous mesh editing methods are based on an elastic deformation model and thus tend to uniformly distribute the distortion in a least squares sense over the entire deformation region . Recent results from image resizing however show that discrete local modifications such as deleting or adding connected seams of image pixels in regions with low saliency lead to far superior preservation of local features compared to uniform scaling the image retargeting analog to least squares mesh deformation . Hence we propose a discrete mesh editing scheme that combines elastic as well as plastic deformation by transferring the concept of seam carving from image retargeting to the mesh deformation scenario . A geometry seam consists of a connected strip of triangles within the mesh s deformation region . By collapsing or splitting the interior edges of this strip we perform a deletion or insertion operation that is equivalent to image seam carving and can be interpreted as a local plastic deformation . We use a feature measure to rate the geometric saliency of each triangle in the mesh and a well adjusted distortion measure to determine where the current mesh distortion asks for plastic deformations i.e . for deletion or insertion of geometry seams . Precomputing a fixed set of low saliency seams in the deformation region allows us to perform fast seam deletion and insertion operations in a predetermined order such that the local mesh modifications are properly restored when a mesh editing operation is undone . Geometry seam carving hence enables the deformation of a given mesh in a way that causes stronger distortion in homogeneous mesh regions while salient features are preserved much better .""",Recent results from image resizing however show that discrete local modifications such as deleting or adding connected seams of image pixels in regions with low saliency lead to far superior preservation of local features compared to uniform scaling the image retargeting analog to least squares mesh deformation.

As a result assembly tolerance representation knowledge has well defined semantics due to the logic based semantics of OWL making it possible to automatically detect inconsistencies of assembly tolerance representation knowledge bases . The mapping relations between spatial relations and assembly tolerance types are represented in Semantic Web Rule Language . Furthermore actual generation processes of assembly tolerance types are carried out using Java Expert System Shell by mapping OWL based structure knowledge and SWRL based constraint knowledge into JESS facts and JESS rules respectively .

Despite the availability of reconfigurable fixtures practical fixture configuration largely remains an experience driven manual activity to enable customization for varying workpiece geometry and most automated solutions do not scale well to accommodate such variation . In this paper we address the problem of rapidly synthesizing a realistic fixture that will guarantee stability and immobility of a specified polyhedral work part . We propose that the problem of automated fixture layout may be approached in two distinct stages .

In particular we show that the candidate restraints mapped to the six dimensional vector space of wrenches may be hashed in a straightforward manner to efficiently generate force closure configurations that restrain part movement against large external wrenches . When clamps are allowed to exert arbitrarily high reaction forces on the part the spatial arrangement of the clamping locations ensures the part is in form closure .

By treating both entities implicitly and homogeneously the optimal design of engineering features and freeform boundary are unified under the level set framework . For feature models constrained affine transformations coupled with an accurate particle level set updating scheme are utilized to preserve feature characteristics where the design velocity approximates continuous shape variation via a least squares fitting . Meanwhile freeform models undergo a standard shape and topology optimization using a semi Lagrangian level set scheme . With this method various feature requirements can be translated into a CSGLS model and the constrained motion provides flexible mechanisms to design features at different stages of the model tree .

This results in a set of quasi parallel curves . The offset is chosen so that a tool moving along the curves has the desired impact at every surface point . In cases where the region of influence of a tool is different across the surface an offset value necessary in one region may lead to a curve offset lower than required in other regions . The paper presents a general method of offset curve construction with tool adaptive offsets . The offset path is obtained as a family of iso curves of an anisotropic distance function of a seed curve on the workpiece surface . Anisotropy is defined by a metric tensor field on the surface . An application independent algorithmic framework of the method for workpiece surfaces represented by a triangular mesh is presented . Its usefulness is demonstrated on the problem of varying cusp heights for milling and for spray coating of surfaces with a spray gun moved by an industrial robot .""",A common approach to the construction of a surface covering path is to take a finite family of offset curves of a given seed curve with increasing offsets.

Using Student mixture model with the variational Bayes approximation we develop a vertex clustering algorithm in the 9 D space composed of three kinds of principal curvature measures along with vertex position and normal component . The normal component is added because it well describes the surface features and is less influenced by noise and the positional component suppresses redundant clusters due to the normal one . Furthermore in order to enhance the robustness for noisy data considering mesh topology as a spatial constraint and letting the vertices in its surroundings belong to the same cluster by diffusion process we protect generating many small fragments due to noise .
