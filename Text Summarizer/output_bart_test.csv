"1. ""We explore the notion of a Well spaced Blue noise Distribution WBD of points which combines two desirable properties. First the point distribution is random as measured by its spectrum having blue noise. Second it is well spaced in the sense that the minimum separation distance between samples is large compared to the maximum coverage distance between a domain point and a sample i.e. its Voronoi cell aspect ratios are small. It is well known that maximizing one of these properties destroys the other and that a well spaced WBD can be improved by optimizing the other. We show that a standard optimization technique can improve the well spacedness while preserving randomness.

3D garments are created by assembling 2D patterns on human models in current mainstream garment modeling methods which usually calls for professional design skills. In this paper a novel approach that decouples the high coupling between garment design and pattern making is proposed. 3D new garment models are created on individual human models by compositing 3D parts from garment examples rather than 2D pattern. The main benefit of our approach is that it is easy to operate and capable to create elegant individualized garments with highly detailed geometries. Our approach is examples based. Garment prototypes represented in Coons surface automatically generated from individual human model are used to guide the garment parts composition and locally parameterize the garment models.

"Abstract. ""There is a critical requirement for semantic interoperability among heterogeneous computer aided tolerancing systems (CATs) in order to meet the growing demand of collaborative product design. But current data exchange standard for exchanging tolerance information among these systems can only exchange syntaxes and can not exchange semantics. Semantic interoperability between heterogeneous CAT systems is difficult to be implemented only with this standard. To address this problem some meta models of tolerance information and an interoperability platform based on these meta models should be constructed and developed respectively. This paper mainly focuses on the construction of a meta model for assembly tolerance types with a description logic ALC based approach.

The framework can not only capture the dynamic geometry features on time varying plates but can also compute the accurate boundaries of the geometry features. The basic idea of the proposed approach is using the multi scale motion flow and surface matching information to propagate the feature frame on the time varying surface. We first define an effective multi scale geometry motion flow for the surfaces which efficiently propagates the geometrical features along the time direction of the surfaces. We then define a multi scale surface matching flow vector which is based on the invariant signature vectors of the time different surfaces. By combining both the approximately invariant surface matching vectors with the geometry flow vectors we also incorporate the shape"
